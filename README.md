bashcheck
=========

Test script for Shellshock and related vulnerabilities

background
==========

The Bash vulnerability that is now known as Shellshock had an incomplete
fix at first. There are currently 4 public and one supposedly non-public
vulnerability.

usage
=====

```sh
./bashcheck [path-to-bash-binary] [--nostrict]
```

It will exit with 0 (zero -- success) when no vulnerabilities are found.

If ```--nostrict``` is specified, it will exit with 0 (zero) if all known
patches are working.  (As of October 1, 2014, CVE-2014-6277 had no fix.)

Patch recommendation
====================

Latest upstream patches (4.3 patchlevel 028, 4.2 patchleven 051) now
include all fixes except for the latest lcamtuf issue.

They also add prefixing to variable functions (a variant of Florian
Weimer's patch) and thus although two known (and some possibly unknown)
parser bugs are still unfixed they should not be exploitable.

My current recommendation: Use latest upstream patches.
